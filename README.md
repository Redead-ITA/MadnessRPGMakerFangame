## FAQ
### How do i download this.
You can download the game by pressing Code>download Zip
#### Make sure also to download the RTP of the RPG MAKER XP, without it, the game won't run https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/run-time-package

### Why do i start in a cube?
That's the debug room, if you want to start the game normaly you need to talk to the guy on the right.

### Will this game cost
No, it never will be, and never i shall allow it.
Plus Matt would probably crush me if i did, that also means you too bootleggers.

### Can i Contribute to this?
I don't expect contributions at all, but if you really want to i can use midi songs potentially of original composition, if you are interested Let me know, via making a thread or by other means, additionally if you really want to do sprites for the project (Not needed really) the color pallete used in this is through the EGA Pallete 
https://lospec.com/palette-list/color-graphics-adapter
If you want to contribute on maps, or anything similar then get yourself RPG MAKER XP

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

I don't know what the fuck i am doing in github.
But if you plan to do modding for this game, Know that in the current state, it's waaaaay too soon to do stuff.

That being said, if you plan to still use assets or make the game then here is what is allowed:
Any of the sprites made for the game are allowed to be used on the condition you don't use it for profit.
If you want to use the midi music of james paddock i'd recommend checking his site and put credit just in case.
